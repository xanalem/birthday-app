This is an HTML page that contains user interface elements, and provides feedback for the user.

Using this, you can enter your birthdate in the form of mm/dd/yyyy into a textbox and then press a button and your age, astrological sign, and how many more days there are until your next birthday will be displayed on the web page, all with the click of one button!
